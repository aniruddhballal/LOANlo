## Frontend Design, UI/UX & Feature Enhancements

**Domain Focus:** Visual design, interactive components, user interface refinement, and accessibility improvements to deliver an exceptional user experience aligned with modern corporate standards.

### ✅ Completed Initiatives (38)

| ID | Initiative | Description |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| 2 | **Styling Framework Implementation** | Implemented comprehensive styling for Login, Register, Dashboard, ApplicationStatus, Profile, LoanApplication, and DocumentUpload pages using modular CSS architecture |
| 7 | **CSS Consolidation** | ~~Unified all module.css files to ensure consistent styling across pages~~ *(Deprecated: Transitioned to vanilla module.css)* |
| 8 | **Design System Overhaul** | Enhanced application-wide styling by transitioning from dark, inconsistent theme to white-based, formal, corporate, sleek, and modern design system |
| 12 | **Tailwind CSS Migration** | Migrated from vanilla module.css to Tailwind CSS framework for improved maintainability and consistency |
| 13 | **Component Library Integration** | Integrated enhanced styling components and iconography from Tailwind CSS library |
| 14 | **Semantic HTML Refactoring** | Refactored Login and Register page structures by converting div elements to semantic form tags |
| 15 | **Accessibility Enhancement** | Implemented keyboard accessibility by enabling Enter key submission for Login and Register forms |
| 18 | **Progress Visualization** | Developed color-coded visual indicators to display fractional progress of document upload completion |
| 19 | **Dynamic Landing States** | Implemented conditional landing animations (Welcome/Congratulations/Error states) that dynamically respond to user actions and navigation context |
| 20 | **Profile Management UX** | Designed and implemented intuitive UI/UX flows for profile editing and deletion functionalities |
| 25 | **Quality Assurance Review** | Conducted comprehensive UI/UX audit and quality assurance review |
| 36 | **Performance Optimization** | Integrated loading spinners and skeleton screen components across all application pages to improve perceived performance |
| 38 | **Feedback System** | Implemented comprehensive success and error messaging system for all modals, forms, and submission workflows |
| 45 | **Intelligent Form Behavior** | Developed intelligent form behavior including auto-scroll, auto-close, and auto-highlight features for Personal Details form input fields to enhance error and success state visibility |
| 49 | **Skeleton Loading Implementation** | Implemented skeleton loading components for Applicant Dashboard, Underwriter Dashboard, and RoleProtectedRoute component |
| 50 | **Modal Viewport Fix** | Resolved UI obstruction issue affecting the bottom viewport area in Underwriter's LoanReviewModal |
| 54 | **Container Optimization** | Fixed dimensional resize glitches occurring in individual document upload submission containers |
| 55 | **Performance Enhancement** | Optimized document deletion functionality to prevent unnecessary full-page reloads on ApplicationStatus page |
| 61 | **Modal Consistency** | Standardized styling for delete confirmation modals across loan applications and documents, ensuring design consistency for dynamically created components |
| 78 | **Interactive Feedback** | Enhanced "Save & Continue" button with custom cursor hover state for improved user feedback |
| 79 | **Button State Fix** | Resolved persistent active state styling issue on "Previous" button that incorrectly carried over to subsequent pages after navigation |
| 92 | **Advanced Data Operations** | Implemented advanced search, sort, and filter capabilities for Underwriters to view specific loan applications with matching results display |
| 93 | **Layout Optimization** | Optimized Dashboard layout by expanding table width to eliminate unused whitespace and improve content density |
| 94 | **UI Consolidation** | Redesigned loan application display on ApplicationStatus page to match the styling pattern used for recent applications on Applicant Dashboard, subsequently removing redundant recent applications section from Dashboard |
| 95 | **Header Alignment** | Adjusted Dashboard header alignment to accommodate wider tabular content layouts |
| 96 | **Contextual Messaging** | Refined profile completion messaging to display "Personal details are required" only for newly created accounts, removing redundant completion messages for users with completed profiles |
| 97 | **Loading Consistency** | Replaced loading spinners with skeleton loaders on ApplicationStatus page for consistency with ApplicantDashboard implementation using SkeletonComponents |
| 103 | **PersonalDetailsRequired Page Styling** | Updated PersonalDetailsRequired component to match email verification page styling - replaced gradient header and decorative elements with centered card layout, changed from red to amber theme, simplified to font-light typography, matched button styling with dashboard theme (gray-900), added back arrow icon, and reduced visual complexity for more formal, professional appearance |
| 111 | **Registration Email Verification UI** | Added `registrationSuccess` state in `Register.tsx` to show a success screen when a user registers but still needs to verify their email, including instructions and verification info. |
| 114 | **Unified Loading Experience for Auth Routes** | Replaced the basic `LoadingSpinner` with the animated `LoadingState` component in both `RootRedirect` and `PublicRoute`, creating a consistent, elegant, and user-friendly loading experience during authentication and redirection. |
| 119 | **Auth Flow: Reuse Centralized Email Verification Component** | Refactored `Register.tsx` to remove inline email verification success UI and reuse the existing `EmailVerificationRequired.tsx` component. Implemented redirect via `navigate('/email-verification-required')` and stored pending user email in `localStorage` for persistence. This unifies verification UX across the app, improves maintainability, and ensures consistent flow between registration and login stages. |
| 122 | **Login Success Animation: Dynamic Message Based on Email Verification Status** | Fixed the login success animation to display the correct message based on email verification status. Added `isEmailVerified` state to `Login.tsx` to capture verification status from the login response immediately. Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to make the `login` function return `Promise<User>` instead of `Promise<void>`, and added `return data.user` statements in both success paths. Changed the success overlay to use `isEmailVerified` state instead of `user?.isEmailVerified` context. Now verified users see "Authentication Successful! Redirecting to dashboard..." while unverified users see "Login Successful! Please verify your email..." ensuring accurate feedback during the login animation. |
| 130 | **Upload Documents: Auto-Redirect After All Docs Uploaded** | In `UploadDocuments.tsx`, updated `uploadDocument` to check `allRequiredDocsUploaded` from API response. On `true`, call `navigate('/application-status')`. Handles post-upload redirect automatically when all 6 documents are uploaded. |
| 131 | **Application Status: Document Upload Animation on Redirect** | Added `highlightedAppId` and `animatingDocs` state in `ApplicationStatus.tsx`. `useEffect` detects `location.state.updatedApplicationId`, triggers `docStatusChange` keyframe on badge and `highlightCard` keyframe on card. Auto-scrolls via `scrollIntoView`, clears after timeout. Fixed `DocumentUpload.tsx` navigation syntax to pass state object with `updatedApplicationId`. |
| 132 | **Loan Application: Split Loading States** | In `LoanApplication.tsx`, separated `checkingPersonalDetails` and `loading` conditions. Added submission-specific loading state with "Submitting Application" title and email confirmation message. |
| 140 | **Reference Number Display Fix** | Fixing display of loan reference numbers on underwriter dashboard and applicant `ApplicationStatus` to show full 24-character ID instead of only last 8 characters |
| 161 | **CurrencyField Digit-Only Input** | Updated `CurrencyField` in `formfields.tsx` to support `onKeyDown` for handling key-level input restrictions. In `loanform.tsx`, added an `onKeyDown` handler to allow only digits, backspace, delete, arrow keys, and tab, preventing invalid characters from being typed into the loan amount field. |
| 166 | **IP Whitelisting System** | Built frontend interface for system admins to manage IP whitelisting. **API Service (`frontend/src/services/ipWhitelistService.ts`):** Created TypeScript functions with JWT authentication: `getCurrentIp`, `getIpWhitelist`, `addIpToWhitelist`, `removeIpFromWhitelist`, `toggleIpRestriction`. Provides type-safe communication with backend API. **Management Interface (`frontend/src/components/IpWhitelistSettings.tsx`):** Developed full-featured component displaying current IP, restriction toggle (disabled when no IPs exist), whitelist table (desktop)/cards (mobile), add/remove IP operations with confirmations, formatted timestamps, empty states, and warning badges. Uses centralized `IpWhitelistSkeleton` for loading states. Handles success/error alerts for all operations. **Login Security (`frontend/src/components/auth/Login.tsx`):** Added error handling for `IP_NOT_WHITELISTED` response code, displaying "Access denied: You are not authorized to login from this network. Please contact support." when users attempt login from non-whitelisted IPs. **Dashboard Access (`frontend/src/components/SystemAdminDashboard.tsx`):** Added "IP Whitelist Settings" card with Shield icon linking to `/settings/ip-whitelist`, giving system admins direct access to whitelist management. **Routing (`App.tsx`):** Added `/settings/ip-whitelist` route pointing to `IpWhitelistSettings` component, integrating whitelist management into app navigation. This frontend implementation allows system admins to view their current IP, add it to the whitelist, toggle restrictions on/off, and manage trusted IPs through an intuitive interface. When restrictions are enabled, login attempts from non-whitelisted IPs are blocked with clear error messages. |

### ⚡ In Progress (9)

| ID | Initiative | Status |
|----|-----------|--------|
| 56 | **Button Style Refinement** | Refining "Begin Application Process" button styles to ensure consistency with application-wide design system |
| 62 | **Error Display Enhancement** | Enhancing styling and animation quality for individual field error displays on Personal Details page |
| 81 | **Interactive Feedback Standardization** | Standardizing button styles and improving interactive feedback across all components, using "Save & Continue" button as design reference |
| 150 | **Underwriter Dashboard Skeleton UI Alignment** | Adjusting `UnderwriterTableSkeleton` component column widths to match actual table column dimensions in `UnderwriterDashboard.tsx` for consistent loading state presentation. Ensuring skeleton placeholders for Reference, Applicant, Contact, Amount, Status, Submitted, and Actions columns align with rendered table structure. |
| 151 | **System Admin Review Modal for Restoration Requests** | Implementing dedicated review modal for System Admin Dashboard restoration requests. Creating modal similar to `LoanReviewModal` that displays comprehensive loan applicant profile details and underwriter profile information before action execution. Consolidating three action buttons (Approve/Reject/Delete) from cluttered table "Actions" column into single "Review" button that opens modal. Modal contains tabbed or sectioned view showing applicant details, underwriter details, restoration reason, and action buttons with appropriate validation (rejection reason required, DELETE confirmation for permanent deletion). Improves UX by reducing table width and providing contextual information before decision-making. |
| 162 | **Unify "Back to Dashboard" Buttons** | Standardize the placement and styling of all "Back to Dashboard" buttons across the app to ensure consistent UX and make it easy for users to locate navigation options. |
| 169 | **Restoration Page Alert Styling** | Replace default browser alert on restoration request page with custom-styled confirmation modal matching the application's design system. |
| 170 | **Button Styling** | Standardize and style all buttons on restoration pages for both underwriter and system admin interfaces to match application design patterns. |
| 171 | **Universal Skeleton Loading Components** | Create centralized, reusable skeleton loading components and replace all custom loading indicators throughout the app with standardized skeletons, similar to the button styling approach. |

| 80 | **Soft-Delete User Accounts** | Added backend endpoints for soft-deleting (`DELETE /profile/me`) and restoring (`POST /profile/restore/:userId`) users, updated frontend `Profile.tsx` to show delete modal, handle deletion with API call, and prevent login post-deletion |
| 82 | **Profile Management Feature** | Added "View History" button to `Profile.tsx` with conditional rendering (underwriters + self-access) using `handleViewHistory()` handler. Created `ProfileHistory.tsx` with `useParams`, fetching from `/profile-history/${userId}`, displaying chronological changes with old/new value comparison, change type badges, timestamps, IP addresses, and field snapshots. Implemented `profileHistory.ts` backend: `GET /api/profile-history/:userId` with dual authorization (underwriters + self), ObjectId validation, rate limiting (30/min), sorted descending, limit 1-100 (default 50); bonus `/stats` endpoint for analytics. Added protected route `/profile/history/:userId` in `App.tsx` with `RoleProtectedRoute` for underwriters and applicants. Registered `/api/profile-history` in server. Security via role-based access at frontend (conditional UI) and backend (auth middleware) |
| 83 | **Permissions Framework** | Finalizing decision framework for user profile deletion permissions and implementation approach |
| 84 | **Tab Switching Logic** | Implemented automatic tab switching from Actions to Application Details upon loan approval/rejection to prevent error states from unauthorized Actions tab access post-decision |
| 85 | **Environment Configuration** | Resolved environment-specific API endpoint discrepancies for document view/download functionality between local and deployed environments |
| 86 | **Storage Migration** | Migrated document storage from Render's ephemeral filesystem to persistent GridFS solution to ensure data durability across redeployments |

| 98 | **Document Protection** | Implemented frontend and backend safeguards preventing deletion of documents associated with approved loan applications |
| 99 | **Data Archival Strategy** | ~~Designing and implementing redundant data archival strategy for deleted documents, loan applications, and user profiles~~ *(Deprecated: (ONLY LOANS AND PROFILES) Document Deletion should not be archived/soft. Profile deletions are soft already, implemented in Task - 80, only pending function is the soft delete the loan applications themselves)* |
| 101 | **Architecture Review** | Assessed data fetching strategy for Underwriter dashboard, confirmed client-side filtering provides better UX and performance for current application volume |
| 104 | **Email Verification Gate for ApplicantDashboard** | Added email verification check to ApplicantDashboard - introduced isEmailVerified state, updated API call to fetch verification status, added red-themed email verification banner prompting users to check inbox, and modified logic to only display "Personal Details Required" section and "Complete Profile" button after email is verified, ensuring users must verify email before accessing profile completion |
| 105 | **Email Verification System** | Added `isEmailVerified`, `verificationToken`, and `verificationTokenExpiry` fields to the User schema, enabling backend support for email verification workflows |
| 106 | **Email Verification Endpoints** | Implemented `/verify-email` and `/resend-verification` routes with rate limiting (max 3 resends/hour), enabling secure and efficient backend handling of email verification and onboarding |
| 107 | **Email Service & Templates** | Created `emailService.ts` for sending verification, welcome, and resend emails via Nodemailer, and `emailTemplates.ts` for dynamic, branded HTML templates supporting LOANLO’s onboarding and account activation flow |
| 108 | **Verify Email Page (Frontend)** | Created `VerifyEmail.tsx` with full UI/UX for verifying, resending, and handling expired email links — featuring animated status states, secure redirects, and LOANLO-branded design |
| 109 | **Email Verification Gate (Personal Details)** | Added email verification check in `PersonalDetails.tsx`, restricting access to unverified users with a branded warning UI and redirect option to dashboard |
| 110 | **Email Verification & Auth Enhancements** | Extended `AuthContext.tsx` to include `isEmailVerified` in `User`, added `verifyEmail` and `resendVerification` methods, updated `register` to indicate if verification is required, enabling email verification flows across the app |
| 112 | **Auth Flow: Enable Registration Success Screen** | Modified `register()` in `AuthContext.tsx` by removing immediate user state update, allowing `requiresVerification` flag to trigger success screen display with email verification instructions before user proceeds to dashboard |
| 113 | **Auth Flow: Use ALLOWED_ORIGINS for Verification Link** | Modified email verification link generation to parse `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable instead of hardcoding `FRONTEND_URL`, ensuring correct link in both development and production environments |
| 115 | **Auth Flow: Post-Registration Login Behavior** | Implemented new flow for user access after successful registration — enabling login only after email verification via the verification link |
| 116 | **Auth Flow: Add Email Verification Required Component** | Created `EmailVerificationRequired.tsx` to display a dedicated screen prompting users to verify their email before accessing their account, with resend functionality, error handling, and navigation back to login for unverified users |
| 117 | **User Schema: Fix Optional Type Definitions** | Updated `IUser` interface in `User.ts` to explicitly allow `undefined` for `verificationToken` and `verificationTokenExpiry` fields, resolving strict TypeScript errors under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` mode |
| 118 | **Router Structure: Fix AuthProvider Hook Context** | Restructured component hierarchy to wrap `<AuthProvider>` inside `<Router>` instead of vice versa, enabling `AuthContext` to use `useNavigate()` hook for programmatic navigation during authentication flows (e.g., redirecting to email verification page after login with unverified email) |
| 120 | **Auth Flow: Unified Resend Verification for Authenticated & Unauthenticated Users** | Refactored `/resend-verification` route in `backend/routes/auth.ts` to support both authenticated (token-based) and unauthenticated (email-based) requests, removing the need for forced login before verification. Implemented security-safe response for non-existent emails. Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to automatically include the user’s email in the resend request when available, ensuring smooth behavior for both logged-in and pending-verification users. This improves usability, maintains security, and aligns frontend–backend verification flow. |
| 121 | **Auth Flow: Fix Email Verification Double-Call and Already-Verified Error** | Resolved critical bug where clicking verification link would briefly show success then immediately display "Verification Failed: Email is already verified" error. Modified backend `auth.ts` to return success response (200) instead of error (400) when email is already verified, and fixed Mongoose field deletion using `undefined`. Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to prevent duplicate verification API calls using `useRef` flag and removed redundant second `/auth/verify` call causing race conditions. Enhanced `VerifyEmail.tsx` with `useRef` to prevent React StrictMode double-execution, simplified `useEffect` dependencies to only track token value, added graceful "already verified" handling to show success screen, and fixed template literal bug in dashboard navigation. |
| 123 | **Email Service: Migrated from SMTP to SendGrid API** | Replaced Nodemailer SMTP configuration with SendGrid API integration in `emailService.ts`, simplifying deployment and ensuring reliable email delivery on cloud platforms. Updated `.env` to use `SENDGRID_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM` instead of SMTP credentials. |
| 124 | **Email Verification: Merged duplicate components into single intelligent component** | Consolidated `VerifyEmail.tsx` and `EmailVerificationRequired.tsx` into a single `EmailVerification.tsx` component that intelligently handles both token-based verification (from email links) and awaiting verification states. The component detects URL token presence to determine flow, eliminating ~400 lines of duplicate code while maintaining all functionality. Updated `App.tsx` routing to use single component for both `/verify-email` and `/email-verification-required` paths. |
| 125 | **Email Verification: Implemented automatic login after email verification** | Modified backend `/auth/verify-email` endpoint to return JWT token upon successful verification, enabling seamless auto-login. Updated `AuthContext.verifyEmail()` to store token in localStorage and update user state. Enhanced `EmailVerification.tsx` to check for token after verification and automatically redirect users to their dashboard via root route, eliminating the need for manual login post-verification. Users now experience a smooth flow: click verification link → see success message → auto-redirect to dashboard. |
| 128 | **SMTP Email Transport** | ~~Tried switching email delivery system from SendGrid back to SMTP with Nodemailer for improved control and reliability~~ *(Deprecated: Render and most free hosting providers block SMTP; use an email API (SendGrid, Resend, Mailgun) instead.)* |
| 129 | **Automated Email Notifications: Implemented comprehensive loan application email system** | Created modular email system with separate templates (`loanApplicationSubmittedTemplate.ts`, `loanStatusUpdateTemplate.ts`, `newApplicationNotificationTemplate.ts`, `documentsRequestedTemplate.ts`) and centralized `loanEmailService.ts` using SendGrid. Integrated four notification triggers into `routes/loans.ts`: applicant confirmation on submission, status updates with conditional approval/rejection content, underwriter alerts via `UNDERWRITER_EMAILS` env variable on review submission, and document request notifications. Modified endpoints (`/apply`, `/update-status/:applicationId`, `/request-documents/:applicationId`, `/:applicationId/submit-for-review`) to trigger emails with responsive HTML templates, application tracking, and dashboard links. |
| 133 | **Profile Page & Navigation Button** | Created `Profile.tsx` with comprehensive user information display including personal details, identity documents, contact info, employment details, and account status — featuring sectioned layouts, formatted data display, and edit profile CTA. Added Profile navigation button to `DashboardHeader.tsx` with user icon, hover effects, and route integration for seamless profile access |
| 134 | **Restore Account Endpoint (Frontend)** | Implementing frontend UI and API integration for admin-triggered account restoration via `POST /profile/restore/:userId` |
| 135 | **Underwriter Profile Access** | Added "Visit Profile" button to `ApplicationDetailsTab.tsx` with role-based visibility (underwriters only) using `User` icon, `useNavigate` hook, and `handleVisitProfile()` handler. Created backend route `GET /api/profile/:userId` in `profile.ts` with underwriter-only authorization, ObjectId validation, and soft-delete checks. Modified `Profile.tsx` to support dual-mode operation via `useParams` - dynamically fetching `/profile/me` or `/profile/${userId}`, conditional header/button rendering (back button for underwriter view, edit/delete hidden for other profiles). Added protected route `/profile/:userId` in `App.tsx` with `RoleProtectedRoute`. Security enforced at frontend (conditional rendering) and backend (role validation) |
| 136 | **Underwriter Email Notifications: Moved auto-review email trigger to document upload** | Refactored email logic for underwriter notifications by moving it from the unused `/submit-for-review` route to the `/upload` route. Now, when the final required document is uploaded and the application status auto-updates to `under_review`, underwriters receive notification emails and applicants receive status update emails. Discovered that the frontend “Submit for Review” button was never rendered due to automatic status updates, allowing removal of redundant UI elements. |
| 137 | **Approval/Reject Comments Visibility** | Evaluating how and where underwriter comments on approvals/rejections should be visible to applicants (modal or email) |
| 138 | **Loan Action History Attribution** | Fixing underwriter actions on loan applications being logged as "unknown" in status history |
| 139 | **Request for Additional Documents** | ~~Auditing backend support and UX for additional document requests (requesting for additional documents would change status from under_review to documents_requested, which on uploading, should change to under_review again, and in case of any inconsistencies/issues with the documents uploaded, underwriter should be able to "request for re-upload of particular/all documents, which would change status from under_review to pending, if the main required documents are re-asking for uploading, else, should move from under_review to documents_requested), ensuring `UploadDocuments.tsx` renders "additional documents" only after underwriter request, improving frontend headings/subheadings to distinguish required vs additional documents, and verifying Indian mandatory vs additional document requirements~~ *(Slightly deprecated and merged with Task - 37)*|
| 141 | **Global Utils Refactor & Time-Based Greeting** | Moved `utils.ts` from `loan/loanreviewmodal/` to top-level `frontend/src/components/utils.ts` to improve reusability across shared components like `DashboardHeader.tsx` and `Profile.tsx`. Removed redundant re-exports from `loanreviewmodal/index.ts`. Updated all dependent imports to reference the new global utils path. Added new `getGreeting()` utility to generate dynamic greetings based on the current time of day. |
| 142 | **Soft-Delete Loan Applications** | Added `isDeleted` and `deletedAt` fields to `LoanApplication` model, modified `DELETE /:applicationId` endpoint to perform soft delete instead of hard delete, added pre-find middleware to automatically exclude deleted applications from queries, and created optional endpoints for restoring (`PATCH /restore/:applicationId`) and viewing deleted applications (`GET /deleted` for underwriters) |
| 143 | **View Deleted Loan Applications (Underwriter)** | Added toggle button in `UnderwriterDashboard.tsx` to switch between active and deleted applications view, created `fetchDeletedApplications` function and state management for deleted applications, implemented `GET /loans/deleted` endpoint for underwriters to retrieve soft-deleted applications, and modified pre-find middleware in `LoanApplication` model to allow explicit querying of deleted documents when `isDeleted: true` is specified |
| 144 | **Restore Deleted Loan Applications (Underwriter)** |~~ Added restore confirmation modal in `UnderwriterDashboard.tsx` requiring "RESTORE" text input for verification, conditionally rendered "Restore" buttons in place of "Review" buttons when viewing deleted applications, and implemented `handleRestoreClick` and `handleRestoreConfirm` functions to manage restoration workflow with dual list refresh~~ *(Deprecated: Underwriters now cannot restore deleted loan applications on their own. System admin must review a "request" for the restoration of an applicant soft-deleted loan application, which would be raised by the underwriter - Refer to Task 148)* |
| 145 | **View & Restore Deleted User Profiles (Underwriter)** | ~~Add toggle button in `UnderwriterDashboard.tsx` to switch between active and deleted user profiles, implement `GET /profile/deleted` endpoint for underwriters to retrieve soft-deleted user accounts, create restore confirmation modal requiring text verification, and add `PATCH /profile/restore/:userId` endpoint with frontend handlers to restore deleted user profiles with list refresh~~ *(Deprecated: Only system admins can view deleted profiles, and only applicants can request for their accounts to be restored. Refer to Task 149)* |
| 146 | **Restrict Deleted Records Access to System Admin** | ~~Update authorization middleware to restrict viewing and restoring soft-deleted loan applications and user profiles to `system_admin` role only, remove deleted records access from underwriter dashboard, add permanent delete endpoints (`DELETE /loans/permanent/:applicationId` and `DELETE /profile/permanent/:userId`) for system admins, and implement role-based access control checks in all relevant backend routes~~ *(Deprecated - refer to task numbers 144, 145 and 148)* |
| 148 | **Restoration Request System & System Admin Dashboard** | Implemented comprehensive restoration request workflow for soft-deleted loan applications. Created `RestorationRequest` MongoDB schema with pending/approved/rejected status tracking, unique constraint preventing duplicate pending requests per application, and performance-optimized indexes. Extended `loans.ts` routes with 6 new endpoints: `POST /request-restoration/:applicationId` (underwriter role), `GET /restoration-requests` (system_admin role with manual population workaround for soft-deleted apps), `POST /restoration-requests/:requestId/approve`, `POST /restoration-requests/:requestId/reject`, `DELETE /permanent-delete/:applicationId` (cascading deletion of application + documents + restoration requests), and `GET /my-restoration-requests` (underwriter-scoped). Removed direct `/restore/:applicationId` PATCH endpoint. Refactored `UnderwriterDashboard.tsx` to replace immediate restore functionality with request-based workflow: added `fetchPendingRestorationRequests()` to track user's pending requests, replaced restore button with conditional rendering showing "Awaiting Admin Review" (Clock icon) for pending requests or "Request Admin" button, and implemented restoration request modal with textarea validation (10-500 chars). Built complete `SystemAdminDashboard.tsx` from scratch with full CRUD operations for restoration requests: search/filter/sort functionality (reference, applicant, underwriter, status, date), three-action review modal (approve/reject/permanent delete) with validation (mandatory rejection reason, DELETE confirmation text), status badges (Clock/CheckCircle/XCircle icons), pending request counter, and mobile-responsive card/table views. Enforces role-based access control across all endpoints (underwriter vs system_admin separation). |
| 149 | **User Profile Restoration System** | Implementing user profile restoration workflow within System Admin Dashboard. Adding view for deleted user profiles ~~with restoration request functionality that applicants can initiate for their own accounts. System admin reviews submitted requests and approves/rejects based on evaluation. Follows similar pattern to existing loan application restoration system with role-based access control (applicant self-request, system_admin review).~~ *(Slight Deprecation: No requests can be raised by the Applicant/User right now, if their account/profile is deleted. They are expected to contact the help centre to communicate and request for account restoration)* |
| 153 | **Restoration Request: Enhance Application Restore Logic** | Updated `/restoration-requests/:requestId/approve` route to explicitly query only deleted applications, prevent restoring already approved applications, add audit trail entry in `statusHistory`, and include detailed response data with `applicationId` and current status |
| 154 | **Loans Route: Modularized** | Refactored monolithic `loans.ts` (900ish lines) into role-based modules: `loans.ts` (applicant routes), `loans/underwriter.ts`, `loans/admin.ts`, and `loans/shared.ts`. Implemented `requireRole()` middleware for router-level authorization, eliminating redundant per-route checks. |
| 156 | **Profile Routes: Role-Based Separation** | Refactored `Profile.tsx` into `ApplicantProfile.tsx` (full details) and `StaffProfile.tsx` (minimal info). Updated routes in `App.tsx` and dynamic routing in `DashboardHeader.tsx` based on user role. |
| 157 | **User Model: Soft-Delete Query Flexibility** | Updated `User.ts` pre-find middleware to exclude soft-deleted users by default **only when `isDeleted` isn’t explicitly queried**. This allows fetching deleted users when needed (e.g., for restoration) without affecting normal queries. |
| 158 | **Loan Application: Track User Deletions** | Updated `DELETE /:applicationId` route to record soft deletions in `statusHistory` with comment `'Application deleted by user'`. This preserves the deletion context for auditing and prevents restoring applications deleted intentionally by users. |
| 159 | **System Admin Restoration Management & Cascading User Deletion** | Redesigned `SystemAdminDashboard.tsx` into navigation hub linking to two new pages: `DeletedLoanApplications.tsx` (restoration request CRUD with approve/reject/permanent-delete) and `DeletedUsers.tsx` (soft-deleted user management with restore/permanent-delete). Added 3 admin endpoints to `profile.ts`: `GET /admin/deleted-users`, `GET /admin/all-users`, `DELETE /admin/permanent-delete/:userId`. Implemented CASCADE logic: `DELETE /me` soft-deletes user's loan applications with statusHistory tracking; `POST /restore/:userId` restores only cascade-deleted applications. Added system_admin RoleProtectedRoute entries to `App.tsx`. |
| 160 | **Deleted Loan Applications: Filter by Active Users** | Updated `GET /deleted` route to only return soft-deleted loan applications whose associated users are still active. This prevents showing applications of users who themselves have been deleted. |
| 164 | **Auth Route: Modularized** | Refactored monolithic `auth.ts` (500ish lines) into modular architecture: `routes/auth.ts` (route definitions only), `controllers/authController.ts` (request/response handlers), `services/authService.ts` (auth business logic), `services/captchaService.ts` (captcha logic), `middleware/rateLimiters.ts` (rate limiting configs), `middleware/captchaRateLimiter.ts` (captcha rate limiting), and `utils/captchaStore.ts` (in-memory captcha tracking). Separated concerns following single responsibility principle, improving maintainability, testability, and code reusability. |
| 165 | **IP Whitelisting System** | Implemented backend IP whitelisting for system admin login security. **User Model (`backend/src/models/User.ts`):** Added `ipWhitelist` array (stores `ip`, `description`, `addedAt`, `addedBy`) and `allowIpRestriction` boolean to enable/disable IP checks per user. **Service Layer (`backend/src/services/ipWhitelistService.ts`):** Created functions to add/remove IPs with duplicate prevention, fetch user whitelists, toggle restrictions (requires minimum one IP), and validate IP formats. Enforces `system_admin` role for all operations. **Controller (`backend/src/controllers/ipWhitelistController.ts`):** Handles requests for getting current client IP, managing whitelist CRUD operations, and toggling restrictions. Returns appropriate HTTP status codes (400/403/500) and normalizes IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. **Middleware (`backend/src/middleware/ipWhitelist.ts`):** Created `checkIpWhitelist` to block unauthorized IPs when `allowIpRestriction` is enabled. Includes `getClientIP` (extracts real IP from proxies/headers) and `normalizeIP` (standardizes IPv6-mapped IPv4). Logs all access attempts and returns 403 for blocked IPs. **Routes (`backend/src/routes/ipWhitelist.ts`):** Established `/api/ip-whitelist` endpoints: GET `/current-ip`, GET `/` (whitelist), POST `/add`, DELETE `/:ipId`, PATCH `/toggle`. All require authentication via `authenticateToken`. **Server Integration (`backend/src/server.ts`):** Applied `checkIpWhitelist` middleware to protect all `/api/*` routes (loans, documents, profiles, profile-history) while keeping auth routes public. Updated CORS to support PATCH requests. Modified auth verify route (`backend/src/routes/auth.ts`) to include IP whitelist checks, ensuring token verification respects IP restrictions. This architecture allows system admins to control which IPs can access protected endpoints when restrictions are enabled, with automatic enforcement across all sensitive API routes. |
