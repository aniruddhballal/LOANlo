    <summary>âœ… <strong>Completed</strong></summary>

1. Start project + initial commit
3. Shift from MongoDB Compass to MongoDB Atlas
4. Modularise the backend server code
5. ~~User Password edit feature~~ Currently removed
6. ~~Ask User for password in case they want to edit their profile~~ User profile and "kyc" has been merged
9. ~~Concept of KYC - create new collection to store UserKYC, set up routing. Check for KYC completion status before giving User access to features of the app.~~ There is a new definition of KYC now
10. Support multiple loan applications for a single individual
11. ~~Allow deletion of Loan Application~~ Temporarily removed
16. ~~User account deletion~~ Temporarily removed, waiting for better PII-KYC logic separation
17. Fix all ts compile errors
21. Create and Assign newer User roles - use them (session/login auth details) to navigate through pages of the website
22. Role protected routing - dynamic redirection
23. Keep a check on the naming conventions
24. Underwriter dashboard - special functions, and API calls
26. State driven routing instead of parameter driven - usecase in DocumentsUpload page
27. Create modals that can be shared across the website, for all users (dynamic-user-customisable)
28. Switch to central axios
29. Global token expiration handling interceptor
30. Conditions to be met for underwriter to take any actions on the loan applications (statuses of the documents uploaded)
31. Add a global 403 Access Denied Page
32. Cross tab auth sync
33. Modularise the LoanReviewModal
34. Revamp the whole project directory structure
35. Review/Download/Delete functionality for all the uploaded documents
37. Flow between pending<->under_review->accepted/rejected/request_documents->pending<->
39. Remove edit/delete account feature
40. Modularise the KYC Component
41. Merge UserKYC and PII/User details collections - reflect it onto the frontend features
42. Modularise the Dashboard page, and make it user-dynamic (reusing same components, pass states and parameters)
43. Input validation for Aadhaar and PAN details
44. Continue button in KYC/PII form has fire-forget model
46. Modularise LoanApplication page
47. Shift from JavaScript backend to TypeScript backend
48. Add the Loan Application Delete functionality back - this time, make sure only applicants can delete it? Should under-writers have all that power? Check auto-refresh/re-render the loan applications once one has been deleted?
51. Clear up backend unused routes - loans.ts, profile.ts, documents.ts, auth.ts
53. LoanReviewModal features are not User Role specific - anyone can view/interact with the upload/delete documents buttons
58. Add a check if the current logged in user is the one who is even viewing/clicking on the delete application/documents button. dont need these checks for the Underwriter because they won't have these features either ways - only Applicants can delete the documents, or the entire loan application. Underwriter should not be able to delete application.
65. User can make the details incomplete and then navigate back and then can be stuck there - because the filed they need to fill, to complete the profile - is on the next page and the continue/next button is not taking them there because the details are incomplete
67. Should failed Captcha attempts cause prevention of login for a while? like ratelimited?
68. doesnt handle edge cases where even after it says incorrect answer, if i click on verify answer again, before the modal closes, it updates the number of attempts taken - shouldnt happen
69. doesnt clear the number of captcha attempts completed/left on successful logins
70. log all the user-details/kyc updates - every update must be recorded with timestamp
71. Applicant name in loanapplication collection does not reflect changes in the profile/user collection - it should not be redundantly stored as a new field, it should simply refer to the applicants userid right
73. it doesnt show why the "continue" or the "previous" buttons are disabled in case of invlaid format of inputs in the personal details form fields - so, modify the label, to hold the formats required for aadhaar, pan, DOB - the errors arent thrown only - the user is just prevented from going forward; currently it just says "enter <label_name>"
74. deploy the website
76. profile complete/update rate limiting combined with the "invalid income range" for fresh applicants who havent filled any other detail out - is a deadly combination that must be prevented at all costs - Update the /save route or create new route for saving/updating details
85. document view/download fetch api call differs for local vs deployed
86. document storage issues - redployment, ephemeral issues
88. dont allow deletion of loan applications once approved - frontend and backend
98. dont allow deletion of documents once approved - frontend and backend

52. Implement Auth0/O-Auth
57. Allow User profile deletion
59. Should applicants be allowed to apply for multiple loans? What's the category of people who can do that? Is there a category?
60. Clean up the interfaces and props - might have fields that I am not using in that page
72. consider renaming middleware auth.ts to middleware.ts and i feel that the original routes/auth.ts is growing too big?
75. integrate AI risk thingy
77. check if all ratelimiters are valid (it seems like it prevents all users from given ip address to not be able to update their profile if some other account has spammed profile update requests) - also check if the limits are set reasonably
80. add the delete account feature back, but then dont actually remove from database, but log it and make sure that it will not be login-able anymore for the user (unless you wanna add the 30-day to delete account feature where if you login within the span of 30 days of applying for account deletion, it will be revived)
83. user profile deletion? should it be allowed?
89. make sure every deletion does not actually mean deletion; keep logs of everything
90. when loan application gets approved - "Updated by: Unknown" is shown
91. what if applicant deletes a document right at the same time as the underwriter approving it
99. documents deletion, loan application deletion, profile deletion - how to store redundant copies of all of these?
100. storing personal details is plain right now, do i need to salt it - am i storing the passwords securely?
